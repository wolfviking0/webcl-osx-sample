### OpenCL Procedural Grass and Terrain Example ###===========================================================================DESCRIPTION:This example shows how OpenCL can be used to create a procedural field of grass on a generated terrain model which is then rendered with OpenGL.  Because OpenGL buffers are shared with OpenCL, the data can remain on the graphics card, thus eliminating the API overhead of creating and submitting the vertices from the host.All geometry is generated on the compute device, and outputted intoa shared OpenGL buffer.  The terrain gets generated only within the visible arc covering the camera's view frustum to avoid the need for culling.  A page of grass is computed on the surface of the terrain asbezier patches, and flow noise is applied to the angle of the bladesto simulate wind.  Multiple instances of grass are rendered at jitteredoffsets to add more grass coverage without having to compute new pages.Finally, a physically based sky shader (via OpenGL) is applied to the background to provide an environment for the grass.Note that the .cl compute kernel file(s) and shader files (.vert and .frag)are loaded and compiled at runtime.  The example source assumes that these files are in the same path as the built executable.===========================================================================BUILD REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.6 or later===========================================================================RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.6 or later with OpenCL 1.0===========================================================================PACKAGING LIST:English.lprojGrass.xcodeprojGrass_Prefix.pchInfo.plistReadMe.txtcamera.cppcamera.hcompute_engine.cppcompute_engine.hcompute_math.cppcompute_math.hcompute_types.hdata_loader.hdata_loader.mgrass_kernels.clgrass_simulator.cppgrass_simulator.hgrid_mesh.cppgrid_mesh.hicon.icnsmain.cppmain.mmesh_renderer.cppmesh_renderer.hshader.cppshader.hsky.fragsky.vertterrain_kernels.clterrain_simulator.cppterrain_simulator.htiming.hversion.plist===========================================================================CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:Version 1.0- First version.===========================================================================Copyright (C) 2008 Apple Inc.
